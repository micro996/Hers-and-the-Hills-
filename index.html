      <h2>A Childhood Marked by Violence</h2>
      <p class="large-text"> i was five years old when I first came to know the harsh reality of violence. It was an ordinary school day, and I was walking with my friends, following the familiar path lined with eucalyptus trees. Near one tree, we saw a thick pool of dried blood. I remember the hushed whispersâ€”someone had been killed. The rift between insurgent groups had claimed another life.<br>
        <br>
        Violence was not an unfamiliar presence in our lives. During encounters between different factions or between the Indian Army and the factions, we had to flee from our homes to safer places. Sometimes, we would lie flat under the bed, behind furniture or wherever we could, hoping to escape the gunfire and chaos. We knew that if we were caught in the crossfire, no one would come to save us. Our parents would urge us to stay silent, to make ourselves invisible. Survival was instinctiveâ€”it had to be.</p>

            <p class="large-text">The Weight of Growing Up in Conflict</p>
            <p class="large-text">Born and raised in a small, isolated town, far removed from the centers of power and development, I grew up under the shadow of AFSPA. The law, the armed presence, and the constant fear were as natural to us as the hills around us. The sounds of gunfire were a constant presence, echoing through the valleys. I grew up in a world where the stories of war were not distant echoes from history books but a part of our everyday life.<br>
              <br>
              I did not understand much back thenâ€”I only heard and accepted that when the military launched operations, men were either killed or taken, and women were subjected to rape, murder, or sexual abuse. I didnâ€™t fully grasp what it meant, but I knew it was something to fear. I remember we used to sit in circles, listening to older women recounting these stories, the narratives that shaped my childhood and were passed down in hushed voices.<br>
              <br>
              As I grew older, those childhood fears gave way to new struggles. The fight was no longer just about surviving in a land torn by conflictâ€”it became about carving out a future, something beyond mere existence. The struggle to get an education, find a job, build a family, and dream of something beyond survivalâ€”all of this became part of a different kind of battle. Yet, even in these everyday struggles, the weight of conflict never truly lifted.</p>

            <p class="large-text">Towards Understanding Peace</p>
            <p class="large-text">Now, as a research scholar working on conflict studies, I constantly find myself questioning the concept of peace. What is this peace that people speak of? Is it merely the absence of war, or is it something deeper? What would bring peace to my homeland, to my people? And beyond that, what would bring peace to my own soul?<br>
              <br>
              I have spent my life witnessing conflict in different formsâ€”first as a child, when I accepted it as a part of the world, and now as a scholar, where I question its true meaning. But the question remains: If I have never known peace, how can I begin to understand it? What does it mean to seek peace in a world so familiar with conflict?<br>
              <br>
              Perhaps, in seeking peace for my homeland and people, I must first understand what it means for my soul to find rest amid the chaos.</p>

      <p>Welcome to Her and the Hills â€” a personal corner of the internet where stories unfold gently, like a walk through quiet hills.

        This blog is a space for reflection, creativity, and connection. Itâ€™s where I share thoughts on life, personal growth, everyday beauty, and the winding paths we all walk. From quiet mornings to big changes, this is where I document the little things that matter â€” and sometimes, the big things too.
        
        Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here. Whether youâ€™re just passing by or plan to stay a while, I hope you find something that speaks to you. Something that feels like a breath of fresh air or a warm cup of tea.</p>
